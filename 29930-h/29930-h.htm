<p class="i0">Sweet odours, radiant colours, glittering light!</p>
<p class="i0">How swift a change from the dusk sodden night</p>
<p class="i2">Of London in mid-winter!</p>
<p class="i0"><i>Titania</i> here might revel as at home;</p>
<p class="i0">Fair forms are floating soft as Paphian foam,</p>
<p class="i2">Bright as an iceberg-splinter.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Dianas doubtless, yet their frost holds fire;</p>
<p class="i0">The snowiest bosom covers soft desire,</p>
<p class="i2">And these are snowy, verily.</p>
<p class="i0">As blanched&mdash;and bare&mdash;as Himalaya's peaks,</p>
<p class="i0">Light-vestured as a troop of dancing Greeks.</p>
<p class="i2">Waltz-measures ripple merrily.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Merrily? Yes; the music throbs with mirth,</p>
<p class="i0">Feet trip in time to it; yet what strange dearth</p>
<p class="i2">Of glee midst all these graces!</p>
<p class="i0">The quickening fire of spirit, passion, will,</p>
<p class="i0">Seems scarce to move these dancing forms or thrill</p>
<p class="i2">These irresponsive faces.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The Shadow smiled. "True, yet not true," he said.</p>
<p class="i0">"Good Form demands that men should look half dead,</p>
<p class="i2">And women semi-frozen.</p>
<p class="i0">Yet Nature lives beneath these modish masks</p>
<p class="i0">Somewhere, sometimes, with energy that tasks</p>
<p class="i2">Caste's rigid rule to cozen.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Pygmalion's prayer breathed life into the stone,</p>
<p class="i0">But see yon graceful girl, with straitened zone</p>
<p class="i2">And statuesque still bearing.</p>
<p class="i0">You'd say in her the marble must invade</p>
<p class="i0">The flesh, in so much loveliness arrayed,</p>
<p class="i2">Such radiant raiment wearing.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Whirled in the waltz's formal maze by one</p>
<p class="i0">Who might be a broad-cloth'd automaton,</p>
<p class="i2">For any show of pleasure,</p>
<p class="i0">She moves with drooping lids, and lips apart,</p>
<p class="i0">And scarce a flush to show that a young heart</p>
<p class="i2">Throbs to the pulsing measure."</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Men meet to moon, and women whirl to wed,</p>
<p class="i0">The cynic says. Is joy in life quite dead,</p>
<p class="i2">Gladness in concourse banished</p>
<p class="i0">From the parades of fashionable youth?</p>
<p class="i0">Have maiden tenderness and manly truth</p>
<p class="i2">From Vanity Fair quite vanished?"</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Soft!" sneered the Shadow. "Questionings like these</p>
<p class="i0">Sound <i>gauche</i> and gushing. Better far to freeze</p>
<p class="i2">To the right social zero,</p>
<p class="i0">Than stoop to zeal and frank display of zest,</p>
<p class="i0">Notes of the vulgar glories that invest</p>
<p class="i2">The housemaid-novel's hero.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Nothing more useful than the surface-ice</p>
<p class="i0">Of stiff stolidity. Vigour, aye, and vice,</p>
<p class="i2">Therein find ready covert.</p>
<p class="i0">Wickedness here may lurk, or even wit.</p>
<p class="i0">Not to name happiness; but naught of it</p>
<p class="i2">Is obvious and overt.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"How bored they look, the slim stiff-collared boys!</p>
<p class="i0">Energy that is eager and enjoys</p>
<p class="i2">They may anon make show of</p>
<p class="i0">In some less honest haunt; here as in pain</p>
<p class="i0">They creak and crawl, devoid of that <i>sans g&ecirc;ne</i></p>
<p class="i2">That virtue seems sworn foe of.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Languidly circumvolving, lounging lank,</p>
<p class="i0">In scuffling circle or in mural rank,</p>
<p class="i2">Of misery mechanic</p>
<p class="i0">They look the wooden symbols; nought to show</p>
<p class="i0">That even well-starched linen's sheeny snow</p>
<p class="i2">Veils impulses volcanic.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"That straight-limb'd son of Anak circling there</p>
<p class="i0">Much like a whirling semaphore, strange care</p>
<p class="i2">His boyish forehead wrinkling?</p>
<p class="i0">The season's catch! His sire, is great in Soap,</p>
<p class="i0">His partner's mother yonder sits; with hope</p>
<p class="i2">Her watchful eyes are twinkling.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"The twirling twain are silent. Silence sits</p>
<p class="i0">Lord of the revel, incubus of wits</p>
<p class="i2">Arch palsier of prattle</p>
<p class="i0">Yet many a girl here mute's a chatterer sweet,</p>
<p class="i0">And many a youth in circles less discrete</p>
<p class="i2">Is an 'agreeable rattle.'</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Respectability's austere restraint</p>
<p class="i0">Rules them relentlessly; smiles forced and faint</p>
<p class="i2">And joyless facial spasms</p>
<p class="i0">Their meetings and their mutterings attend.</p>
<p class="i0">Jerky approximations quickly end</p>
<p class="i2">In void unvocal chasms.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Yet still they circle, and yet still they loll.</p>
<p class="i0">A marionette wooing a wooden doll</p>
<p class="i2">Would look more animated</p>
<p class="i0">Than yonder pair, revolving interlaced,</p>
<p class="i0">Exchanging commonplaces leaden-paced,</p>
<p class="i2">Or repartees belated."</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Mammon by day and maundering at night</p>
<p class="i0">Oh, Shade!" I cried, "can furnish scant delight,</p>
<p class="i2">The Race for Wealth is rapid.</p>
<p class="i0">How can the feverish rush find true relief</p>
<p class="i0">In heartless intercourse, as bald as brief,</p>
<p class="i2">Amusement vain as vapid?"</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Amusement? Intercourse? They scarce exist."</p>
<p class="i0">The Shadow answered. "Some B&oelig;otian mist</p>
<p class="i2">Society blinds and muddles.</p>
<p class="i0">True recreation in this joyless round?</p>
<p class="i0">The sea's bright changefulness as soon were found</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"The cliques and coteries know not how to mix.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Concourse, not intercourse, is what you see:</p>

<p class="i0">These meet, like marbles mingled in a bag,</p>

<p class="i0">Boredom, and sheer banality.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"The strongest symptom of quick life crops out</p>
<p class="i0">In watchful mutual mockery. Gibe and flout</p>

<h2>AU REVOIR!</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span> <i>and</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">J. L. Toole</span> <i>discovered smoking a last cigar</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> And so, my dear <span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>, you are leaving us at once?</p>

<p><i>Mr. J. L. T.</i> Yes, Sir, but I hope soon to be back again. I am looking
forward to the voyage as an excellent digestive to all the luncheons,
dinners, and suppers I have been taking for the last five or six weeks.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> I have no doubt they have been a little trying&mdash;eh, <span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>?</p>

<p><i>Mr. J. L. T.</i> And yet, as I have observed in the <i>Upper Crust</i>, "they
were very welcome." But, Sir, how did I get through my oratory? Did you
notice my speeches at the Garrick and the Savage? Which did you prefer?</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> I heard the first, and read a report of the second, and can
conscientiously declare they were equally good.</p>

<p><i>Mr. J. L. T.</i> I am glad to hear you say so, Sir. I confess I didn't
think there was <i>much</i> to choose between them. And now (<i>with deep
emotion</i>), will you excuse my glove?</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> No; I won't say good-bye; for wherever you may roam, my dear
<span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>, you will have this consolation&mdash;you will find me there before
you!</p>

<h2>HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT.</h2>

<h4><i>Hints from the Chancellor of the Exchequer's correspondence.</i></h4>

<p>Sir,&mdash;If you wish to immortalise yourself as Chancellor of the
Exchequer, now is your opportunity. You have a surplus, I believe, of
eight or nine millions? This is about the figure required to provide the
Members of the London County Council with a moderate-sized palace, not
perhaps entirely suited to their exalted dignity, but, at least,
sufficient to house them in something like proper and fitting style. A
site should be secured on the Embankment, by clearing away Somerset
House, and the intervening buildings, including the blocks of the Inner
and Middle Temple, which could all be carted away and re-erected further
down, say, at Millbank, and on the space thus secured a white marble
structure could be reared with an adequately imposing fa&ccedil;ade facing the
river, that would in some slight degree represent the majesty of the
illustrious body destined to occupy it. I don't say that nine millions
would be enough thoroughly to carry out the design I have in view, but
your surplus might serve as a central fund to begin upon, to which
Parliament, no doubt, would cheerfully add another five or six millions
if required. Such an obvious use for your money, I feel, needs no
further argument from yours encouragingly and suggestively,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">A Full Blown London County Councillor</span>.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I have several near relatives in the Colonies, with whom I have,
owing to the present exorbitant rates for postage, not communicated for
many years. This fact has suggested to me that <i>the</i> golden opportunity
now offers itself to you of re-uniting family ties, re-opening closed
correspondence, restoring natural affection in otherwise hardened
breasts, and, in a word, consolidating the Empire, it may be, for
countless ages yet unborn. Spend your surplus, Sir, in providing this
country and all her dependencies with a <i>farthing postage</i>&mdash;mind, not a
<i>penny</i>, but a <span class="smcap">Farthing Postage</span>! I read somewhere that the actual cost
to the Government for the transport of letters was at the rate of ten
for a penny. Thus your four millions sunk in the enterprise ought to
produce you an immediate profit, at least so I make it, of six millions
a year. But, profit or no profit, think of the boon to thousands of
Englishmen like myself, who could then stand a penny-worth of
correspondence in the year, with children with whom now they are unable
to communicate, owing to the cruel and crushing charge of fivepence for
a single letter. Picture one who, though not close over money matters,
and full of love for his offspring, must yet sign himself</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">A Circumspect and Cautious Parent</span>.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Have you read Lord <span class="smcap">Wolseley</span>'s article in this month's <i>Harper</i>? He
advises a higher rate of pay for the rank and file of the British Army?
<i>Verbum sap.</i> You understand. It is clear what you must do with your
surplus. Ensure <span class="smcap">Tommy Atkins</span> six-and-six-pence a day, and you will have
every Regiment in the Service thronged with real live Gentlemen. This is
what is wanted (so I gather from Lord W.'s article) to make the British
Army, if not the most costly, at least the most respectable in the
world. Come, Sir, do not make it necessary that you should be reminded a
second time of your plain and obvious duty by</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">A Sanguine and Expectant Private</span>.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;There can be no doubt in regard to the proper destination of those
surplus millions, the fitting disposition of which, I am informed, is
involving you in no little perplexity. They seem in a special manner to
furnish the legitimate answer to the almost universal cry, now going
forth, for "Free Education." Here then is your opportunity. And it is a
magnificent one. Your surplus will enable a wise and paternal Government
to give not merely education, free of cost, to every child in the three
kingdoms, but will supply it with ample means to infuse the very highest
culture attainable into the very dregs of the population. Spanish,
Italian, German, Russian, French, Chinese, together with riding,
dancing, painting in oil colours, hydrostatics, and the elements of
Court etiquette, will, henceforth, comprise the curriculum of the
veriest gutter-child.</p>

<p>Can you, Sir, contemplate such a brilliant, such a soul-stirring
prospect unmoved? That you cannot, and will at once hand over your
useful millions for the purpose of carrying into effect the above modest
but magnificent scheme, is the firm belief of yours suggestively,</p>

<p>"Bring me my Scotch Dictionary!" cried the Baron. "Alas, my Lord!" was
the answer of the faithful servitor, "there is none such here."
"I'fakins!" quoth the Baron, "then will I buckle to and read <i>A Window
in Thrums</i> without it, even though I break all my teeth and nigh choke
myself, as indeed, I have well-nigh done in my gallant attempt to master
the first two chapters." So I, the Baron, being convalescent and having
a few hours to spare, lay me down and read, and read, and read, and
stumbled over the Scotch words and phrases, until I hit on the plan of
reading it aloud to two or three other convalescents; just to see how
<i>they</i> would like it. And as I read aloud, this book,&mdash;which on account
of its apparent difficulty, and by reason of my education having been
neglected, "lang syne," in respect to the Scotch language, an intimate
knowledge of which I have not yet acquired "the noo,"&mdash;it gained my
affection gradually, steadily, and increasingly. Though I could not have
translated individual words and phrases, yet I instinctively understood
them, and was delighted with the homely simplicity of the style, the
keen observation, the shrewd wit, and the gentle pathos of <i>A Window in
Thrums</i>. The <span class="smcap">Baron de Book-Worms</span> is grateful to Mr. <span class="smcap">J. M. Barrie</span>; and
when an opportunity is offered him, he is seriously thinking of
re-reading some of the Scotchiest of Sir <span class="smcap">Walter Scott's</span> Novels, and
having a "Nicht or twa wi' <span class="smcap">Robbie Burns</span>."</p>

considerable interest.</p>

Beresfords</i>,&mdash;no relation to Lord <span class="smcap">Charles</span> of that ilk,&mdash;starts, and will
make the reader start too, with a very creepy idea. The story would have
been a genuine weird and eerie one but for the continual twaddling
interruptions about "spookikal" research and metaphysical problems,
which, however, the experienced skipper, who knows the chart, can easily
avoid after the first two or three bumps, and even the inexperienced
reader will be able, after an hour or two, to hop from point to point
like a robin from twig to twig. But skipping and hopping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> is wearying,
and the story is too long, and so we become familiar with the ghost, and
we all know what the fatal consequence of familiarity is. The
repetitions of the Spook's appearance are monotonous. Had <i>The Weird</i>
been condensed like milk in tins, or essenced like Liebig, and been
presented to the public as a story in two numbers of <i>Blackwood</i> (always
such an appropriate title for a Magazine full of mysterious
stories,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Black Wood</span> so like Black Forest) or <i>Macmillan</i>, or <i>Cornhill</i>
(where, somehow, a ghost-story always reads uncommonly well), this
romance would have created a great sensation. As it is, it doesn't, at
least not much. <span class="smcap">Baron de Book-worms.</span></p>

<h2>MR PUNCHS MORAL MUSIC-HALL DRAMAS</h2>

<p>Our present Drama (No. VI.) represents an attempt to illustrate upon the
Music-hall Stage the eternal truth that race <i>will</i> tell in the long
run, despite&mdash;but, on second thoughts, it does not <i>quite</i> prove that,
though it certainly shows the unerring accuracy of parental&mdash;at least,
that is not exactly its tendency, either; and the fact is that <i>Mr.
Punch</i> is more than a little mixed himself as to the precise theory
which it is designed to enforce. He hopes, however, that, as a realistic
study of Patrician life and manners, it will possess charms for a
democratic audience.</p>

on his extreme sweetness, his strongly marked character, the variety of
his tastes, and the singular attraction he has for children of all

has selected for attaining his majority&mdash;he has gratified us all by
plighting troth to his cousin, the Lady <span class="smcap">Rose Caramel</span>, with whose dulcet

<p><i>The Earl</i> (<i>haughtily</i>). I did, upon discovering that you were in the
habit of surreptitiously carrying off kitchen-stuff, concealed within
your umbrella. But proceed with your narration.</p>

<p><i>Horeh.</i> I swore to be avenged, and so&mdash;(<i>common form again; the shifted

<p><i>The Earl.</i> This is indeed a startling piece of intelligence. (<i>To</i> Lord

<p><i>Lord B.</i> Let my youth and inexperience at the time, Sir, plead as my

<p><i>The E.</i> Nothing can excuse the fact that you&mdash;you, a low-born son of

which were the due of your Patrician foster-brother. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Coltsfoot</span>.)
Approach, my injured, long-lost boy, and tell me how I may atone for

<p><i>Colts</i>, (<i>to</i> Lord B.). These 'ere togs belong to <i>you</i> now, young

<p><i>Lord B.</i> (<i>with emotion, to</i> Countess). Mother, can you endure to
behold your son in tights and spangles on the very day of his majority?</p>

<p><i>Countess</i> (<i>coldly</i>). On the contrary, it is my wish to see him attired
as soon as possible, in a more appropriate costume.</p>

<p><i>Lord B.</i> (<i>to</i> Lady R.). <span class="smcap">Rose</span>, <i>you</i>, at least, have not changed? Tell
me you will love me still&mdash;even on the precarious summit of an acrobat's
pole!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rose</i> (<i>scornfully</i>). Really the presumptuous familiarity of the
lower orders is perfectly appalling!</p>

<p><i>The Earl</i> (<i>to</i> Countess, <i>as</i> Lord B. <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Coltsfoot</span> <i>retire to
exchange costumes</i>). At last, <span class="smcap">Pauline</span>, I understand why I could never
feel towards <span class="smcap">Bullsaye</span> the affection of a parent. Often have I reproached
myself for a coldness I could not overcome.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> And I too! Nature was too strong for us. But, oh, the joy of
recovering our son&mdash;of finding him so strong, so supple, so agile. Never

the spangled vest of the humblest acrobat. Your foster-brother, brief as
our acquaintance has been, has already endeared himself to all hearts,
while you have borne a trifling reverse of fortune with sullen
discontent and conspicuous incapacity. He has perfected himself in a
lofty and distinguished profession during years spent by <i>you</i>, Sir, in
idly cumbering the earth of Eton and Oxford. Shall I allow him to suffer
by a purely accidental coincidence? Never! I owe him reparation, and it
shall be paid to the uttermost penny. From this day, I adopt him as my
eldest son, and the heir to my earldom, and all other real and personal
effects. See, <span class="smcap">Robert Henry</span>, that you treat your foster-brother as your
senior in future!</p>

<h2>KICKED!</h2>

<center>(<i>By the Foot of Clara Groomley.</i>)</center><br />

<center><span class="smcap">Chapter IV. and Last.</span></center>

<p>In the little sitting-room above his shop sat Mr. <span class="smcap">Assid Ropes</span>. It was
the afternoon before Christmas Day. He had generously allowed all his
assistants to leave. "If anybody wants their hair cut, or their hat
ironed," he said, "I'll do it myself, and then they'll wish they
hadn't."</p>

<p>Yet, when a customer rapped on the floor below, Mr. <span class="smcap">Ropes</span> felt
exceedingly angry.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he called down the stairs.</p>

<p>"I want my hat ironed," said a clear, manly voice.</p>

<p>"Go away! Your hat doesn't want ironing. Go to bed!"</p>

<p>"I will not go away," said the clear, firm voice, "until you have
attended to my hat&mdash;hat once, if you please."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ropes</span> came grumbling down the stairs. For one moment he gazed at the
man in the shop, and then flung his arms round him and wept tears of
joy.</p>

<p>"My dear old friend, <span class="smcap">Cyril Mush</span>!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>They had been boys together at Eton, and rowed in the Trinity boat
together at Cambridge. Fate had separated them.</p>

<p>In less than a minute they were talking over old times together in the
little sitting-room over the shop. <span class="smcap">Cyril Mush</span> was delighted. "You can't
charge an old friend anything for just ironing his hat," he said, with
his peculiarly winning smile.</p>

<p>Before Mr. <span class="smcap">Ropes</span> could correct this impression, another voice was heard
in the shop below.</p>

<p>"Can you come down for a minute&mdash;to oblige a lady?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ropes</span> descended once more. In a minute he returned.</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry, <span class="smcap">Mush</span>, but I must go. I've got to shave a dead poodle,
and the men are coming to stuff it at nine o'clock to-night. It's for a
lady&mdash;<i>noblesse oblige</i>, you know. I'll finish your hat when I come
back."</p>

<p>In a second he was gone. <span class="smcap">Cyril Mush</span> replaced the lining in his hat, and
placed it on his head. He went out into the streets. He was wondering
what poodle it was which Mr. <span class="smcap">Assid Ropes</span> had gone to shave. Could it be
the same? No, most certainly not. So of course it was the same.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Mr. <span class="smcap">Ropes</span> had arrived at the house, and had been
ushered into the chamber of death. The light was very bad, and he
happened to cut the animal while engaged in shaving it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<a href="images/077.png">
<img src="images/077.png" width="100%" alt="Cartoon" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Very sorry, Sir," said Mr. <span class="smcap">Ropes</span>, from force of habit, "but it's not my
fault. You've got a pimple there, and you jerked your head just as I was
going over it. A little powder will put that all right."</p>

<p>Suddenly it flashed across him that the poodle was not dead if the blood
flowed. He rushed out of the room, and found himself confronted by a
handsome, wicked-looking man, of about thirty.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Sir, but that poodle's not dead. It's in a trance. Just run
down to the kitchen and fetch me some brandy, some blankets, and some
hot bricks, and I'll bring it round."</p>

<p>"The dog <i>is</i> dead, and in a very few hours he'll be stuffed," was the
cruel reply. "You needn't trouble to bring it round. If you've brought
your tackle round, you can shave it."</p>

<p>"I've been shaving it&mdash;and that's how I know."</p>

<p>A door opened on the other side of the passage, and a fair young girl
came out in tears and a black dress.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, <span class="smcap">Algernon</span>?" she said.</p>

<p>"It's nothing, <span class="smcap">Alice</span>. This idiot says that <i>Tommy's</i> not dead."</p>

<p>With one wild yell of joy, a yell that broke the gas-globes, and
unlinked carriages at all the principal London railway stations, <span class="smcap">Alice
Smith</span> fell senseless on the floor.</p>

<p>"Out you get!" exclaimed her cousin <span class="smcap">Algernon</span> to Mr. <span class="smcap">Ropes</span>. "If the dog
is not dead, come back in two hours, and <i>prove</i> it&mdash;otherwise it will
be dead, and stuffed too."</p>

<p>"Now then," said <span class="smcap">Algernon</span>, when Mr. <span class="smcap">Ropes</span> had gone, "if <i>Tommy Atkins</i>
is not dead, he soon will be." He grasped his walking-stick, and tried
the door of the room. It was locked. Mr. <span class="smcap">Ropes</span> had locked it, and taken
the key!</p>

<p>"Aha!" he exclaimed. "Baffled! Baffled! Kindly turn the lime-light off
the swooned maiden, and throw it on to me. Sympathetic music from the
violins, if you please."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>One hour had passed. Mr. <span class="smcap">Alkaloid</span>, the photographer, had met Mr. <span class="smcap">Mush</span>.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Alkaloid</span> had come from Ryde to London to get his hair singed. The
two accidentally met Mr. <span class="smcap">Ropes</span> as he was dashing wildly down the street
towards his own shop. In one minute all was explained. Mr. <span class="smcap">Alkaloid</span> had
fetched his photographic apparatus, and the three were careering back to
the house where the poodle lay dead. But was he dead? You know he
wasn't, as well as I do. What do you ask such senseless questions for?
"It's the only sure test," said <span class="smcap">Alkaloid</span>. "If that dog's alive, he'll
wag his tail when I try to photograph him. I never knew it fail."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Outside the door of that gorgeously-furnished room stood an excited
group. <span class="smcap">Algernon</span>, the villain, was soliloquising. <span class="smcap">Alice</span> was explaining to
<span class="smcap">Cyril</span> how he had dropped his note down the neck of the wrong girl&mdash;who
was also named <span class="smcap">Smith</span>&mdash;and how she had been compelled to believe him
unfaithful. Mr. <span class="smcap">Ropes</span> was listening attentively at the key-hole, and
<span class="smcap">Cyril</span> was kissing <span class="smcap">Alice</span>.</p>

<p>Within the room Mr. <span class="smcap">Alkaloid</span> was photographing the dead poodle. (I call
it dead, but of course that doesn't humbug <i>you</i>.)</p>

<p>"Now then, we're ready," they heard Mr. <span class="smcap">Alkaloid</span> say. "Don't stare. Just
a natural, easy&mdash;now then&mdash;thank you!"</p>

<p>There was dead silence within the room and without. Then the door
opened, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Alkaloid</span> came out cheerfully.</p>

<p>"The poodle's dead all right," he said. "What you took to be blood,
<span class="smcap">Ropes</span>, was blacking off your razor. You really ought not to strop them
on your boot. I'll walk round to your shop with you. I want my hair
singed."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span> went into hysterics; <span class="smcap">Algernon</span> swooned with joy; and <span class="smcap">Cyril Mush</span> had
a fit.</p>

<p>At the moment of going to press, they are all three still in the above
condition. The dog, in the meantime, has been accidentally stuffed with
the stuffing intended for the stuffer's Christmas goose. The goose was
found, on carving, to be stuffed with several shilling shockers, which
had been intended to pad the poodle.</p>

<p>And to what better use could they have been put&mdash;especially if they were
all like this?</p>

<h2>THE PREMIER'S POWER.</h2>

<center><i>Brief Fragment of a current Historical Romance.</i></center>

<blockquote><p>[It is whispered that the <span class="smcap">Prime Minister</span> has of late taken too much
into his own hands the conduct of the foreign affairs of the
Government.&mdash;<i>Smoking-room Gossip.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Prime Minister</span> stood upon the rug, with his back to the fire, and
regarded his assembled colleagues with an imperious and angry scowl.
There was a profound and significant silence for several minutes. At
length it broke. He was addressing them once more.</p>

<p>"You understand the official relationship that exists between us. You
are my creatures. I am your Master. What I originate, you accept. I act,
you endorse. Do I," he continued, his voice rising to a shrill, piping
treble, "do I make myself sufficiently clear?"</p>

<p>A sickly smile of abject acquiescence overspread the features of the now
trembling Ministers. Their Chief noted it with a gloomy glare. Then with
a furious gesture, he suddenly kicked a waste-paper basket into the air.
"You may go!" he growled. They did not wait for a second permission.
Swiftly, but obsequiously, they glided out of the room, and with traces
of terror stamped on their blanched countenances, silently sought the
little neighbouring Railway Station, and took the next train to London.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>That night the Premier sat up late. But his work, when he began it, did
not take him long. Yet it was not unimportant, for the departing
mail-bag carried a set of sealed orders for the Admiral in Command of
the British Squadron in East African Waters, another Ultimatum to the
Government of Portugal, a threatening communication to the Porte, and
disturbing despatches, threatening to the peace of Europe, to the
Governments of Russia, France, and Germany respectively. He laughed long
and loud when he thought of their contents. Then he went to bed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Later on, his work bore fruit; and people then said that the Cabinet of
the day must have been a strange one!</p>

<p>I'm a beginning for to think as we're rayther a rum lot in this werry
strawnery world of ours. I've jest bin a collectin from sum of my
brother Waiters sum of their little historys, as far as they remembers
'em, and werry strange and werry warious sum on 'em is. There's one pore
chap who's about as onest and as atentif a Waiter as I nos on anywheres,
but you never, no never, ewer sees him smile, not ewen wen a ginerus old
Deputy, or a new maid Alderman, gives him harf-a-crown! I've offen and
offen tried to cheer him hup with a good old glass of ginerus port, wen
sum reglar swells has bin a dining and has not emtied the bottels&mdash;as
reel Gennelmen never does&mdash;but never quite suck-seeded, tho' he drank
down his wine fast enuff and ewidently injoyed it quite as much as if
he'd paid for it, praps jest a leetle bit more. So one day I wentured to
arsk him how it was as he was allers as sollem as a Churchwarden at a
Charity Sermon, or a Clown in summer time, and he told me as it was all
causd by the suckemstances of his hurly life, which he had never been
abel to shake off hisself, pore Fellar! tho' they was none of 'em his
own fault, which they was as follers.</p>

<p>To begin with. He was born on a Fryday, on the 1st of April, and amost
all his days for years after seems to have been either Frydays or Fust
of Aprils, sumtimes one, sumtimes tother, sumtimes both. He was the
youngest of eleven children, and so made the family party consist of 13,
always as we all knos a unlucky number, and he seemed to have been
treeted as if it had bin his own fault, which in course it wasn't, not
by no means, no more than it was his fault the having the Skarlet Fever
on one Crismus Day, which he did to heverybody's disgust.</p>

<p>He was afterwards told by his old Nuss <span class="smcap">Becky</span> that one speshal greevance
of his pore mother was, that her youngest child being seven years old
when <span class="smcap">Billy</span> was born, all the warious prepperashuns customary on such
himportant occasions had been dun away with as useless, ewen to the
customary gigantick Pincushon, so that in his case there was no "Welcum
to the Little Stranger!" So long, too, as his oldest brother remained at
tome, he was never allowed to set down to dinner with the rest of the
famerly, because, in course, he made up the unlucky number, the werry
nateral consequence being, that when his oldest brother suddenly took
his departure from among 'em, poor little <span class="smcap">Billy</span> was werry severely
flogged for setting down to dinner with a smiling countinghouse! Of
course ewery time as his unfortnit Birthday came round he was made a
April Fool of, all his six lovin Brothers jining in the sport, one arter
the other, nearly all day long. When he went to school, ewerybody knowed
of his afflickshun, and made a fool of him, hushers and all.</p>

<p>After he growed up, his Father got him a plaice at a Lunatic Asylum, as
being the most properest for his sollem natur; and there he remained for
no less than five years!</p>

<p>Then, on the other hand, there's old <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, or rayther yung <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, for he's
one of them jolly chaps as never seems to get no older. Why he goes
about a grinning away, and a chatting away, and a chaffing of old <span class="smcap">Bill</span>,
who's much younger than him, like anythink. So I naterally arsked him
how he acounted for his good sperrits. And what was his arnser? Why,
hurly training. His Father was a Comic Play Actor, and allers ready for
a larf, and offen took yung <span class="smcap">Tom</span> with him to the Theater till he becum
quite a favrite with all the merry gals there, who used to pet him, and
give him sweets, and teach him to say all sorts of funny things; and,
when he was old enuff, he was promoted to the dignity of a full-blown
Super, at 18 shillings a week, and all his close found. His grate
differculty was in looking serious and keeping serious when serious
bizziness was a going on; and on one occashun, when he was playing one
of a band of sangwinerry ruffians, sumthink so took his fansy, that he
not only bust into a loud larf hisself, but set all the rest of the
sangwinerry ruffians a larfing too, and quite spiled all the effect of
the scene. So he was bundled off neck and crop, and soon afterwards got
a sitewashun as a Pleaceman, but, for the life of him, he never could
keep hisself serious when he was before a Magistrate with a case; for if
ennybody made a joke, or ennybody larfed, <span class="smcap">Tom</span> set off a grinning with
the best of 'em, and once axshally made a joke with his Worship; so of
course off he was sent again, to find a rest for the soles of his feet,
and a free play for his good sperrits, in the honnerabel capacity of a
Waiter.</p>

<p><i><b>ouse</b> of Commons, Tuesday, February 11.</i>&mdash;"How do you do, <span class="smcap">Toby</span>? A merry
New Session and many of them."</p>

<p>It was <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> who spoke; his kindly face beamed on me; his
friendly hand grasped mine. Walked up the floor together through the old
familiar scene. Benches crowded, though a vacant seat here and there:
<span class="smcap">Hartington's</span> for example. Everybody sorry to hear he's been ill, and
glad to think of him enjoying the sunlight of Monte Carlo. Grand Old Man
more Grand and less Old than ever; just up from Oxford; passed very
well, it is said. Comes into Parliament with every prospect of
distinguishing himself; his maiden speech looked for with much interest.</p>

<p>"I think I'll put it off for a month or two, <span class="smcap">Toby</span>," he said, blushing
with the ingenuousness of youth. "You see I'm so fresh from college,
that it would ill become me to plunge into public affairs. It's all very
well for a young fellow like me to get up at the Union; but here it's
different. You're very good to say that great things are expected of me;
but, if you please, I'll keep in the background a bit. I'll feel my feet
first, as they used to say in the nursery, in what seems only
yesterweek."</p>

<p>Very nice this of him. Wish all young fellows fresh from the University,
even when they have taken honours, were equally modest.</p>

<p>"Haven't seen you since we met at Greenlands' icy mountains in the
Recess," <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> said, continuing our conversation interrupted by
the cheers that greeted our arrival. "You remember how bitterly cold the
day was? Rather thought you hurried away. Wish you could have stayed to
luncheon. We happened to have something succulent. However, you must
come and dine in my room behind the <span class="smcap">Speaker's</span> Chair; <span class="smcap">Akers-Douglas</span> will
show you the way. We do it pretty snug there, I can tell you. What sort
of a Session shall we have? Who can tell? Usual sort of thing, I
suppose. We shall bring in a lot of Bills; Gentlemen opposite will talk
some of them out; at Easter and Whitsuntide Recesses we shall squeeze a
stage of some through, under pressure of the holidays; then three weeks
in June and most of July will be wasted; and in August we'll suspend
Standing Orders, and ram through everything we can. As for me, I shall
endeavour to do my duty to the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>, to the Country, and to the Members
of this House, in whichever part they sit. Did you ever, dear <span class="smcap">Toby</span>,
consider how a kettle boils? The water nearest to the fire is first
heated, and (being heated) rises to the top. Its place is supplied by
colder portions, which are heated in turn, and this interchange takes
place till all the water is boiling hot. That is how we shall get
through the Session. The Report of the Parnell Commission, being most
heated, will rise to the top first. Then the Tithes Bill, Land Purchase,
the Education question, and one or two other little matters will follow,
till we're all in boiling water. Good-bye now; don't forget to come
across <span class="smcap">Akers-Douglas</span> about Eight o'Clock."</p>

<blockquote><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Session opened.</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Killing for a Shilling</span>.&mdash;Lord <span class="smcap">Wolseley</span> (who seems to have read the
regulations governing communications from soldiers to the Press in a
very liberal spirit) has published an article on the British Army in the
pages of an American Twelvepenny Magazine. The contribution is
embellished with sketches of the costumes of <span class="smcap">Tommy Atkins</span> and his
predecessors. For the rest, some of the letterpress is sufficiently
alarming to warrant "Our Only General" in assuming a title which he
apparently appears to covet&mdash;that of a "Shilling Shocker!"</p>

<h2>SOMETHING LIKE A DINNER.</h2>

</div>

<p>Now that the Parliamentary Session has opened, and the Season threatens
to set in with its usual severity, the dinner question comes prominently
to the front. Even in the best-regulated households there is a sameness
about dinner which, towards the end of the week, palls upon the
appetite. Some ambitious young men have attempted to deal with the
matter and surprise their guests by introducing cheese immediately after
the soup (<i>souffl&eacute; au parmesan</i>), and after a cut of beef comes the fish
(<i>turbot &agrave; la Russe</i>). That is well meant, but it is crude. <i>Mr. Punch</i>
has given his great mind to the subject, and presents to the
consideration of the dining world the following hints for a meal:&mdash;</p>

<p>It may be objected that half-and-half, even when badly spelt, is a cold
preparation for dinner; and others may take exception to <i>Poukenvorm</i>,
as likely to have an earthy taste. But did they ever try it <i>gebakken in
Berg-op-Zoomsche Stijl</i>? It is no use mincing matters. Let anyone in
search of a good dinner enter any well-appointed <i>restaurant</i>, and order
this <i>menu</i> right through down to <i>Pupen en Tabak</i> (which is not a
preparation of dog's meat), and if they are not satisfied, <i>Mr. Punch</i>
is a Dutchman.</p>

<h2>"RICHARDSON'S SHOW" AND A "BILL OF THE PLAY."</h2>

<p>The Vaudeville, when it was opened, was devoted to all that was light
and cheerful. Comedy and Burlesque went hand-in-hand, and the audience,
if ever asked to weep, were begged to cry with laughter. But Mr. <span class="smcap">Robert
Buchanan</span> (with the assistance of the late Mr. <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>) "has changed
all that." <i>Clarissa</i>, the present attraction at the little theatre on
the North-side of the Strand, is a piece of the most doleful character.
The First Act is devoted to a very heartless abduction, and the last to
a lingering death and a fatal <i>duello</i>. When it is announced that the
successful fencer who "kills his man" is no less a person than that
excellent Comedian, Mr. <span class="smcap">Thomas Thorne</span>, it will be readily understood
that "the New Drama" is the reverse of lively. <i>Clarissa</i> has scarcely a
laugh in it from beginning to end. Certainly, in the last Scene but one,
there is a revel, in which "pseudo-Ladies of Fashion" take part, but the
merriment with which it is spiced is decidedly ghastly. Miss <span class="smcap">Winifred
Emery</span> is exceedingly clever, but her death-scene is painfully
protracted. Mr. <span class="smcap">Thalberg</span>, as <i>Lovelace</i>, is a sad dog in every sense&mdash;a
very sad dog, indeed. The only incident in the piece ever likely to
provoke a smile, is the appearance of some comic bearers of grotesque
sedan-chairs. When <i>Clarissa</i> is carried out <i>&agrave; la</i> <span class="smcap">Guy Faux</span> at the end
of the Second Act, there is certainly a moment's hesitation whether the
audience should cry or laugh. But the sighs have it, and
pocket-handkerchiefs remain to the front. On the occasion of the initial
performance, some slight amusement was caused by the introduction of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Buchanan</span> in unconventional nineteenth century morning dress amongst the
old-fashioned costumes of the company; but, of course, the slight
amusement was for once and away, and could not advantageously be
frequently repeated. Thus, take one thing with another, the life of the
Vaudeville audiences at this moment cannot be truthfully described as a
merry one.</p>

<h4>Something Lively at the Vaudeville.</h4>
</div>

<p>At the Avenue quite a different story may be told. People who visit this
pretty little house desirous of being moved even unto tears by that
finest of <i>Fausts</i>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>, will be disappointed&mdash;they had far
better stay at home, or go to see <i>Clarissa</i>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Hamilton A&iuml;d&eacute;</span> has
adapted from the French of <span class="smcap">Carr&eacute;</span> (a case of fetch and carry) a Farcical
Comedy in Three Acts, which <i>he</i> calls <i>Dr. Bill</i>, in preference to <i>Dr.
Jojo</i> the Gallic original. The prescription from which the Doctor
concocts his mixture might have been supplied by the Criterion. Mr.
<span class="smcap">Frederick Terry</span> plays a part that would have suited Mr. <span class="smcap">Wyndham</span> down to
the ground, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Chevalier</span> is continually suggesting the
peculiarities of Mr. <span class="smcap">Maltby</span>. Miss <span class="smcap">Fanny Brough</span> is Miss <span class="smcap">Fanny Brough</span>,
which means that no one could play the part so well, much less better.
For the rest, the company (although a new one) work together with a "go"
that carries all before it. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span> has certainly conquered the
world&mdash;of Comedy. He may do less wise things if he rests satisfied, and
leaves Tragedy alone for an indefinitely lengthened period.</p>

</div>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Jerome's</span> new piece (which he describes as "comparatively
speaking, new and original"), just produced at Terry's Theatre, is
rather disappointing. Its title of <i>New Lamps for Old</i> strongly
suggests a "Night's Entertainment." But when the poverty of the plot and
the quality of the dialogue are taken into consideration, it would be
almost too much to say that this pleasant idea is fully realised by the
evening's performances. It must be confessed, however, that Mr. <span class="smcap">Penley</span>,
rising and descending in a dinner-lift, is (at first) funny; and Miss
<span class="smcap">Cissy Grahame</span> is ever welcome.</p>
